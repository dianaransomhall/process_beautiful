 	 	<h3 class="spacing">b3.js</h3>
		<h4>October 2015</h4>
		<p>HackDartmouth 2015. We all know that data visualization is extremely useful to make sense of data. You may have heard of d3.js? Have you heard of c3.js? They're web graphing libraries that help us make sense of online data.
		<br></br>
		Web graph libraries combine the accessibility of the Internet and providing easy to understand visualizations for datasets! But they are typically 2D perspectives. What about graphs that rely on three variables? What about 3D? I created b3.js as an open source library to allow users to create 3D graphs on their web application that are manipulatable with the Oculus and Leap Motion.</p>

		<p>The second annual "Global Appathon"! This is a 12-hour fun sized hackathon for mobile development, open to all students to work on mobile projects. Pocket Converter. On YouTube, perhaps, you've come across that one song, instrumental or vocal cover that blows your mind. You listen to it once only to be annoyed that you have to hit the replay button. Adding salt to the wound, you'll always need Wi-Fi or 3G on your phone to listen to that song! 
		<br></br>
		Pocket Converter is an Android app that seeks to solve that frustrating problem. Through YouTube's internal app, while you're jumping from vid to vid and find that song that you love, you can easily store the vid as an MP3 to your music player. We allow you to hit the share button, click the Pocket Converter icon, and essentially pocket the song for later. Now, you can keep the song and play it with or without Wi-Fi or 3G anytime, anywhere.</p>

		<h3 class="spacing">PennApps</h3>
		<h4>January 2015</h4>
		<p>CM4D is a crowd-sourcing cloud application that works on every device. By harnessing the excess power of every user's CPU from their web browser, CM4D performs computations and gives users Bitcoins in return. Jobs can be deployed to connected users. These computations are performed behind the scenes. Afterwards, the result is returned to the job owners. From the connected user's perspective, the browser will perform jobs submitted, receiving Bitcoins in exchange for the service.</p>

Their goal was to help customers search for a product by location, reducing the number of clicks to find the location and availability of a product. Their app provided immediate availability in the map. They used the Intel XDK and the Best Buy API. Excellent presentation.</p>

 	 	<h3 class="spacing">UCONN CyberSeed Software Challenge 2014</h3>

 	 	<h3 class="spacing">Livh</h3>
		<h4>September 2014</h4>
		<p>Proper latch, suction level, positioning, size, shape, and proper instructions were all described as part of the design challenge of breast pumps. How do women learn of the "right" way? As a result, creating a virtual reality Oculus Rift environment with interactable features using the infrared hand-motion-tracking Leap Motion, we tried to invent an experimental place to "test" different breast pump models and learn the procedure hands on. 
		<br></br>
		The target users are moms or anyone who wants to have a hands on experience of using a breast pump in virtual reality to get the hang of the motions and standard steps. 
		<br></br>
		Simulations are powerful! They can teach us, so our group sees VR as the future of countless inventions as virtual reality expands to health. Hence, the name Livh, LEAP INTO VIRTUAL HEALTH!</p>

 	 	<h3 class="spacing">Music in Motion</h3>
		<h4>September 2014</h4>
		<p>Music In Motion was a Leap Motion powered virtual turntable. The turn table was controlled by simply hand motions. Fast forward and rewind by moving your hand back and forth respectively and moving your hand left or right muted the respecitive audio track are the current features impletmented. 
		<br></br>
		There was also a an equilizer component that uses RGB LEDs. The equalizer simply read changes in voltage via a transistor from an audio source and controls the voltage output to the LED strips. 
		<br></br>
		This was a quick weekend project to help promote my hackerspace at Boston University's Splash. Splash was a an event for incoming or returning students to find clubs that they're interest in.</p>
